To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of rub and buff onto the entire ornament there. And then of course, we have to get that antique look with the alcohol ink. So I went in with the ginger first, I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just blended it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and With digital tools, it is easier than ever to create, edit, and publish your work to the world. But there's a cost. It's also easier than ever to spread misinformation, and fake news has become a real issue in recent times. We see this with students. According to a Stanford study, only 25% of high school students were able to identify an accurate news story compared to a fake one. Students also had a hard time distinguishing between real and fake photographs as well as authentic and staged videos.
