To create the antique brass ornament, just went with a coat of and buff onto entire ornament there. And then of course, we have get that antique with the alcohol ink. So I went in the ginger first, applied a droplet onto our ornament and just it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers I liked, and looked antiqued and like an actual metal After that, I in with little bit more of that burnished amber paint as well and to supply that to the surface, to of give it that oxidized like we did the bell ornaments. And is how I finished off these brass baubles. simple and easy, but they look like real metal and beautiful.
