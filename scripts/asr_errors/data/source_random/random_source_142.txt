To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of and buff onto the entire ornament there. And then of course, we have get that antique look with the alcohol ink. So I went in the ginger first, I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antiqued and like an actual metal After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber paint as well and to supply that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized like we did for the bell ornaments. And is how I finished off these antique brass baubles. Really simple and easy, but honestly, they look like real metal and they're beautiful.
