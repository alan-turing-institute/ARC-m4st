To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of rub and buff onto the entire ornament there. And then of course, we have to get that antique look with the alcohol ink. So I went in with the ginger first, I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just blended it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antiqued and like an actual metal ornament. After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber spray paint as well and to supply that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized look like we did for the bell ornaments. And that is why Me completed shut theys vintage copper trinkets. Actually direct additionally simple, however sincerely, it gaze similarities authentic alloy also there stunning.
