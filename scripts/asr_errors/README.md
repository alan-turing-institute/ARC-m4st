# Impact of ASR Errors

This is a short, pretty contrived, example of how ASR errors may impact the different metrics. The hope was to demonstrate that BLASER-2 has a clear advantage in this regard.

## Input Data

This uses a single source audio file from the WMT24 subset, available here: https://data.statmt.org/wmt24/general-mt/. The file is: `test-en-speech-audio/YGkZRb3aer8_001.wav`

The transcript and reference translation for this file are available here: https://storage.googleapis.com/mt-metrics-eval/mt-metrics-eval-v2.tgz. The data corresponding to the WAV file above is line 792 of the English to Spanish (`en-es`) files under `wmt24/sources` (for the transcript) and `wmt24/references`.

For more details about the WMT24 data see the repo: https://github.com/google-research/mt-metrics-eval, and web-site: https://www2.statmt.org/wmt24/translation-task.html

This file and the associated text are saved as `data/source.wav`, `data/source.txt`, and `data/reference.txt` here.

`alt_source.txt` is from line 781 of the same data.


### Corrected Transcript

`data/source_corrected.txt` contains a corrected version of the source transcript, which in WMT24 is originally generated by ASR. The original source contains a few minor errors, the most noticeable being an instance of "bubbles" instead of "baubles".
